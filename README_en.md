# Transferring data from Yandex Object Storage into Yandex Managed Service for PostgreSQL through Yandex Data Transfer

With [Data Transfer](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/data-transfer), you can transfer data from your [Object Storage](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/storage) to a managed database under [Managed Service for PostgreSQL](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/managed-postgresql). See [this tutorial](https://yandex.cloud/docs/data-transfer/tutorials/object-storage-to-postgresql) to learn how to set up the solution with Terraform. This repository contains the configuration file you will need: [objstorage-to-postgres.tf](objstorage-to-postgres.tf).
